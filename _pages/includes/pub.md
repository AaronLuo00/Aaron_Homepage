## Working Projects

- **Healthcare AI Safety and Reliability Research**  
  Working with the [CRITICAL dataset](https://critical.fsm.northwestern.edu/) on exciting healthcare applications. Also exploring LLM reasoning traces and addressing a fundamental challenge: when AI models are used in healthcare applications, either through single LLM calls or an agentic system, there is a strong need to fully understand when and how AI models fail, and how to fix those issues to prevent catastrophic consequences.
