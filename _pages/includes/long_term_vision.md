# ðŸŒ± Long-term Vision

I aspire to become a compound talent who deeply understands large-scale medical data, multi-modal learning, and end-to-end clinical applications. My long-term goal is to bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI research and real-world healthcare impact, driving both technical innovation and product commercialization. Ultimately, I hope to promote a more equitable distribution of medical resources, enabling better healthcare access and outcomes for all, and bringing broader benefits to society.
