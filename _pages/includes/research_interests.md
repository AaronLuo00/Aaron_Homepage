# ðŸ”¬ Research Interests

- **Flexible Diagnostic Models with Multi-task and Multi-modal Learning**: I work on developing advanced AI models that can simultaneously handle multiple diagnostic tasks while effectively integrating various types of medical data (imaging, clinical notes, lab results) to provide more comprehensive and accurate medical assessments.

- **Democratizing Healthcare Access through AI Agents**: I am dedicated to developing intelligent healthcare agents that make medical resources and consultations more accessible and convenient for everyone. This includes creating AI systems that can provide preliminary medical advice, assist in resource allocation, and bridge the gap between patients and healthcare providers.
