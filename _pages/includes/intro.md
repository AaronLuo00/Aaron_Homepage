I am a Ph.D. student in Engineering Science at [Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/). You can reach me via email at [xiaolongluo@g.harvard.edu](mailto:xiaolongluo@g.harvard.edu) or phone at [+1 617-909-8782](tel:+16179098782). My research focuses on developing the foundations of next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and applying them to address challenging managerial and societal problems.

# ðŸ”¬ Research Interests

- **Theoretical Foundations of AI**: I work on the theory of reinforcement learning, deep learning, and large foundation models through the lens of statistics and optimization. The goal is to push forward the understanding and to improve the training and inference mechanism of AI models in a principled manner.

- **Large Language Models Capabilities and Alignment**: I work to push the boundary of planning and reasoning capabilities while enhancing the alignment of LLMs through the way of reinforcement learning.
