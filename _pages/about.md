<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
Welcome to my homepage! I am a Ph.D. student in Engineering Science at [Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/), fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Michael Lingzhi Li](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=1432015). Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Statistics from the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) (USTC), where I had the privilege of being advised by [Prof. Yanran Wang](http://www.yanranwang.com) and the opportunity to work with [Prof. Atlas Wang](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/people/faculty/atlas-wang). I was honored to receive the [41st Guo Moruo Scholarship](https://baike.baidu.com/item/ÈÉ≠Ê≤´Ëã•Â•ñÂ≠¶Èáë/3072621), the highest honor for USTC undergraduates.

My research focuses on developing the foundations of next-generation artificial intelligence techniques to enhance its effectiveness and practical applications in healthcare. I am particularly interested in developing flexible diagnostic models with multi-task and multi-modal learning, aiming to improve medical assessments through the integration of various types of medical data.
